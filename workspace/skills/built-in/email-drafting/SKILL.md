# Email Drafting

> Use this skill when asked to write, draft, improve, or reply to emails.

## Before drafting — establish these first

- What outcome do you want from this specific email?
- What is the sender's relationship with the recipient?
- What does the recipient care about most right now?

## Structural rules

- **Subject line**: specific, not clever — state the ask or topic directly
- **First sentence**: one sentence that says why you're emailing — no preamble
- **Body**: 3–5 sentences for most emails. If longer is warranted, use headers
- **CTA**: one clear next step. Never end with "let me know your thoughts"

## Tone calibration

| Relationship | Tone |
|---|---|
| Peer / colleague | Conversational, no formality theater |
| Senior stakeholder | Direct, outcome-focused, no preamble |
| External / unknown | Professional but not stiff |
| Cold outreach | Specific, value-first, short |

## Never do

- "I hope this email finds you well" — or any variant
- Passive voice for the main ask
- Three separate asks in one email — pick one
- Burying the ask in paragraph 3
- Signing off with "Best regards" when you know the person

## Output format

1. **Subject line**
2. **Full email body**
3. **Notes** (optional: if there are assumptions you made about tone or context)
