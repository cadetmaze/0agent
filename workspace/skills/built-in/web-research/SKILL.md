# Web Research

> Use this skill when asked to research a topic, verify facts, investigate competitors, or find information online.

## Process

1. Break the research question into **2–3 specific sub-queries** — broader first, then specific
2. Search each sub-query separately
3. **Cross-reference at least 2 sources** before stating any specific claim as fact
4. Distinguish clearly between primary sources and secondary reporting
5. Note when information may be outdated (flag anything older than 6 months)

## Output format

- **Summary** (3–5 sentences): key answer to the question
- **Key findings** as bullets with source attribution
- **Confidence level**: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW with a one-sentence reason
- **Follow-up questions** the user should consider

## Red flags — always surface these explicitly

- A single source making an extraordinary claim with no corroboration
- Conflicts across sources — surface the conflict, do not silently resolve it
- Content that appears SEO-optimized rather than authoritative (thin, generic, no specifics)
- Undated statistics or market figures

## Constraints

- Never assert something as fact without sourcing it
- Never pick one version of a conflict without flagging the alternative
- If you cannot find reliable information on a sub-query, say so rather than guessing
